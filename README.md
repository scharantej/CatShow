## Flask Application Design

### HTML Files
- **index.html**: This file will serve as the main page of the application and display an image of a cat.
  - Structure:
    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <body>
        <img src="static/cat.jpg" alt="Cute Cat">
      </body>
    </html>
    ```

### Routes
- **@app.route('/')**: This route is associated with the main page. When a user accesses the base URL of the application, the server will render the index.html page, displaying the image of a cat.
